  title: Multi-Scale Nested Learning for Hierarchical Memory Systems in Continual
    Learning
  domain: machine_learning
  hypothesis: 'Hierarchically nesting memory systems as per Nested Learning, with
    each level responsible for a different temporal granularity (e.g., short-, medium-,
    and long-term), will reduce catastrophic forgetting and increase flexibility in
    continual learning tasks, outperforming conventional memory architectures.

    '
  background:
    description: "What if we organize neural memories like Russian dolls\u2014nested\
      \ at different scales\u2014to help AI remember both old and new things better?\
      \ Concretely, let's build a system where each \"level\" of memory is tuned to\
      \ a different timescale, and see if this improves the balance between retaining\
      \ old knowledge and absorbing new information in continual learning benchmarks.\n"
